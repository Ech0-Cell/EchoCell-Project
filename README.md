# Echo Cell Project
This project is developed by Bahcesehir University Engineering students.

# Rules
Let's set up some basic rules for our development cycle of this project.

1) Every Pull Request must have explanatory description/comment. (If changes are small, state.)
2) Every week there is going to be a weekly meeting about our progress. (Please try your best to attend.)
3) If you are having a highly instense semester, make sure to do weekly tasks because they will make your work step by step. Do not overwork:)
Most importantly, we are all adults here. That's why I didn't think setting up strict rules would make sense. So let's pay respect to each other, work as a team and don't forget our responsibilities.
