# Echo Cell Project
This project is being developed and maintained by Bahcesehir University Engineering students.

# Rules
Let's set up some basic rules for our development cycle of this project.

We are all adults here. That's why I didn't think setting up strict rules would make sense. So let's pay respect to each other, work as a team and don't forget our responsibilities.
   
# Week 1 - ToDo
